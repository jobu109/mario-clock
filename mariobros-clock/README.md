# Mario Bros. Clock
************************************************************************

This is based off of jnthas original mario bros clock project. I have just modified/added some code to spruce things up a little for my own preferences. 

- removed the hill and bush objects
- added a pipe object
- adjusted cloud positioning
- added goomba sprite with animation
- added koopa sprite with animation
- added piranha sprite with animation
- added 2 coin sprites with animation
- added collision detection with animation betweeen mario landing and goomba squishing
- added collision detection from blocks to make koopa hide
